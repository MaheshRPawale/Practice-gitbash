Save this script as delete_lines.sh, then you can run it from the terminal by providing the filename as an argument, like this:

bash delete_lines.sh your_file.txt

Replace your_file.txt with the name of the file you want to modify. This script will delete lines containing the word <dd> if it appears between the 5th and 7th position and save the modified file.
